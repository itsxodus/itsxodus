                    Welcome to my personal website! My name is Matthew Lamour
                    (my online alias since 2016 is 'XoDus'), and I am  
                    an <a className="ul-text">aspiring full stack software engineer</a>. I use
                    various tools and technologies you can <a className="ul-text">learn more about below</a>. 
                    I am currently a student at the University of New Haven, 
                    set to graduate in May 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in
                    Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.  I am also
                    a graphic designing, Japanese language learning, and PC 
                    building hobbyist.
                    <br/><br/>

                    My philosphy when it comes to not only software development,
                    but life in general, is to <a className="ul-text">always be learning and adapting</a>.
                    There is always something new to learn in this world, 
                    and this field, like life itself, is ever-changing. I always
                    try to be as adaptable and resourceful as possible
                    whenever I am faced with a new challenge, so <a className="ul-text">expect this site
                    to be updated frequently with new technologies learned and
                    new projects created</a>!
                    <br/><br/>

                    I am always looking for new <a className="ul-text">opportunities 
                    to learn and grow from others</a>, and love finding
                    new projects to work on, no matter my prior level of 
                    experience! I am open to new opportunities for internships
                    and full-time positions. Feel free to reach out to me via
                    my <a className="ul-text">contact information at the bottom of this page</a>, 
                    preferably through email!
